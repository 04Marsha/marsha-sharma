      <h3>🧩 Analytical Problem Solving</h3>
      <p>
        I start by breaking problems into smaller steps so I can plan better and
        build things that last.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="approach-card">
      <h3>🗂️ Organized Development Process</h3>
      <p>
        I follow a clean and simple workflow — planning first, writing neat
        code, and improving step by step.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="approach-card">
      <h3>🔍 Debugging with Patience</h3>
      <p>
        When something breaks, I figure out why, fix it, test it, and learn from
        it to avoid the same issues again.
      </p>

    <div class="approach-card">
      <h3>🎯 Working with Clear Goals</h3>
      <p>
        I always keep the goal in mind — whether it&rsquo;s making something
        faster or easier to use.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="approach-card">
      <h3>🔁 Always Learning</h3>
      <p>
        I try out new tools and techniques often, and keep learning from
        tutorials, documentations, and real projects.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="approach-card">
      <h3>🎨 Design + Function</h3>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t just build things that work — I also think about how they
        look and feel for the user.
